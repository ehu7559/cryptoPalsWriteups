# Write-up Accompaniment to CryptoPals Challenges: Set 1

## Challenge 17: The CBC padding oracle

The padding oracle attack uses the knowledge of whether or not the plaintext has
valid PKCS#7 padding at the end to obtain the decrypted form of a given
ciphertext without knowledge of the key.

## Challenge 18: Implement CTR, the stream cipher mode

## Challenge 19: Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitutions

## Challenge 20: Break fixed-nonce CTR mode statistically

## Challenge 21: Implement the MT19937 Mersenne Twister RNG

This challenge is relatively straightforward, hence the short description on the
challenge page.

The Mersenne Twister makes the


## Challenge 22: Crack an MT19937 seed


## Challenge 23: Clone an MT19937 RNG from its output

## Challenge 24: Create the MT19937 stream cipher and break it
