# cryptoPalsWriteups
A set of writeups for the CryptoPals challenges. Obviously, it contains spoilers.

I have endeavoured to make my code at least generally understandable to those who are semi-fluent in Python and reading/doing the challenges along with me. However, since I have almost certainly failed to achieve that, each set gets its own writeup file with a writeup for each fo the eight challenges. 

Interesting Things:
Challenges 7, 10, and 18 include by-hand implementations of AES128 in ECB, CBC, and CTR modes respectively.
Mostly written in spare time at work.
