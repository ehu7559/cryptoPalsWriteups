# cryptoPalsWriteups
A set of writeups for the CryptoPals challenges. Obviously, it contains spoilers.


## Introduction:
I have endeavoured to make my code at least generally understandable to those who are semi-fluent in Python and reading/doing the challenges along with me. However, since I have almost certainly failed to achieve that, each set gets its own writeup file containing a writeup for each of the eight challenges.

## Recommended Use:

For the viewer's pleasure, I recommend having the following open side-by-side when viewing a given challenge:

### For a given Challenge (Set A, Challenge B)
Open the following (replacing A and B with the appropriate numbers)
```
- set[A]guide.md (the file containing the writeup)
- s[A]c[B].py (the file containing the code for the challenge)
- https://cryptopals.com/sets/[A]/challenges/[B]
```



## Interesting Things:
Challenges 7, 10, and 18 include by-hand implementations of AES128 in ECB, CBC, and CTR modes respectively.
Mostly written in spare time at work.
