# Write-up Accompaniment to CryptoPals Challenges: Set 2

## BRIEFING:

This is the first of several sets on block cipher cryptography. This is bread-and-butter crypto, the kind you'll see implemented in most web software that does crypto.

This set is relatively easy. People that clear set 1 tend to clear set 2 somewhat quickly.

Three of the challenges in this set are extremely valuable in breaking real-world crypto; one allows you to decrypt messages encrypted in the default mode of AES, and the other two allow you to rewrite messages encrypted in the most popular modes of AES.

## Challenge 9: Implement PKCS#7 padding

## Challenge 10: Implement CBC mode

## Challenge 11: An ECB/CBC detection oracle

## Challenge 12: Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)

## Challenge 13: ECB cut-and-paste

## Challenge 14: Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)

## Challenge 15: PKCS#7 padding validation

## Challenge 16: CBC bitflipping attacks
